# Bilateral Filter Implementation in Python

Bilateral filter is an edge-preserving smoothing filter for images. 

## What's Included
 
* **Implementations** of the Bilateral filter in Python: naive, vectorized, and colored vectorized.
* **Examples** of the colored vectorized implementation on three different images.
* **A paper** that explains the theory behind the Bilateral filter algorithm (Recommended).

## How To Verify
4. Run `python3 colored_vectorized_bf.py`

You'll see output in the src folder with the prefix 'output_'
